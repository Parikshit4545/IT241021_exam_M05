To configure Windows 11 Notepad to prompt users to save files when closing, you need to ensure that the application behaves like other text editors, like Notepad++ or even older versions of Notepad, that ask users if they want to save unsaved work before closing. ### Problem Clearance and Research Historically, Windows Notepad did not prompt users to save unsaved files before closing. This has been a common user complaint, as it can lead to accidental loss of unsaved data. Since Windows 10 and Windows 11 have evolved, users now expect more robust features from basic applications like Notepad. As of Windows 11 (and Windows 10), Microsoft did not enable this feature by default in Notepad. It’s likely because they are keeping the app as simple as possible, focusing on speed and minimalism. This behavior isn't natively customizable through settings in the Notepad application itself. ### Current Solutions There are a couple of workarounds for this issue: 1. **Use a Third-Party Text Editor**: One of the easiest ways to ensure that the user is prompted to save files is by switching to a more feature-rich text editor like **Notepad++**, **Sublime Text**, or **Visual Studio Code**, all of which provide automatic prompts to save unsaved files upon closing. 2. **Use Notepad’s Built-In Features**: While Windows Notepad doesn't prompt users to save unsaved files directly, it does have a feature where, if you try to close the app with unsaved files, it will show a small "unsaved changes" notification in the title bar (in some versions). However, it does not offer a "save prompt" as expected in more sophisticated text editors. 3. **Enable Windows 11's "Always Prompt to Save" Behavior (via Settings or Registry Hacks)**: There isn't a specific registry key or setting that modifies the behavior of Notepad to prompt for saving. The default behavior still applies, meaning it won't ask before closing. ### Long-Term Solution In the longer term, you could advocate for Microsoft to add this feature to Notepad in a future update or request it through the official Windows Feedback Hub. Users have asked for this feature for years, but it's unclear if Microsoft plans to implement it natively. ### Conclusion Unfortunately, as of now, there is no direct setting in Windows 11 that forces Notepad to prompt users to save files before closing. The most effective and widely used solution remains using a third-party text editor like **Notepad++** for more advanced saving features.
